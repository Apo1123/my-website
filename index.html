            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Living with food allergies can be a daily struggle. Diagnosed with multiple food allergies for several years, I know firsthand how it feels to constantly worry about what's in your food. The hardest part, though, isn't just the fear of allergic reactionsâ€”it's the loss of spontaneity. The simple joy of eating out with friends, trying new dishes at a restaurant, or grabbing a quick bite on the go becomes a complex and stressful decision-making process. At NutriGuard, we understand these challenges. That's why we created a solution that helps bring back the freedom to enjoy life without the constant worry.</p>
